### A simple neural network for character characterization

## Background
Neural network is a machine learning approach that has recently became very popular. It is an approach inspired from how networks of biological neurons operate. In this system, nodes, analogous to neurons, are connected with each other via edges, analogous to synapses. Generally speaking, the goal of any neural network is to learn to classify data into their appropriate categories; for example, one of Facebook's AI had learned to recognize individuals based on pictures.

## Proposal
I'd like to build and train a neural network that is able to recognize images of characters.

For example, if I feed the following image below into the system, the system should output "a".
'.#####.' +  
'#.....#' +  
'#.....#' +  
'#######' +  
'#.....#' +  
'#.....#' +  
'#.....#'
